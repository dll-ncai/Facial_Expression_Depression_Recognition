# Facial_Expression_Depression_Recognition

A research-oriented library containing multiple deep learning models for facial depression recognition, developed by Dr. Muhammad Turyalai Khan and other researchers.

This library provides a unified framework for implementing, comparing, and extending various facial depression recognition methods.
Each method can be trained, tested, or used for feature extraction.

Current methods included:
